this is the implementation of Dijkstra in python. i made this program as a support to my bigger project: SDN Routing. I write this dijkstra algorithm to find shortest path and hopefully i can develope it as a routing protocol in SDN based python language. this code that i've write consist of 3 graph that represent my future topology. 

if you read this and you have a same vision and interest in SDN (Software Defined Network), please mail me, i need a lot of support from another developer: alitrahmasari@gmail.com
